#Find a expression for a sequence of numbers
Input: a string of numbers separated with comma(,) for example: 7,9,4,2
Use three operators add(+) minus(-) and equal(=) to make a correct expression

For example: ```7-2+4=9``` or ```9-7=4-2``` or others.
equal(=) has to be included only once.
e.g. input:1,1,1,1 expression:```1=1=1=1``` is not a valid expression, ```1+1-1=1``` is a valid expression.

If the input string can be made at least one such expression, output: YES, otherwise output: NO
